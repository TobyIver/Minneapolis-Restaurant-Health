# Minneapolis-Restaurant-Health
Final Project MCTC projects class

This app provides health inspection information on restaurants from 05-03-2011 to 05-29-2013.  
You can search by name or GPS location.

It searches Google Places threw an API to return an .xml file with information on restaurants.  Then it will use that information to query a second online database to return the health inspection data for each restaurant in a .json file.  
The .xml data and .json data are combined to provide the information.  The scoring system is based on the type and number of violations and was made up by me.   

All the code and folders are here to open in Android Studio.
