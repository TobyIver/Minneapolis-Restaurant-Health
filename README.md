# Minneapolis-Restaurant-Health
Final Project MCTC projects class

This app provides health inspection information on restaurants from 05-03-2011 to 05-29-2013.  
You can search by name or GPS location.

It searches a google places threw an API to return an .xml file with information in restaurants.  Then will use that information to query a second online database to return the health inspection data for each restaurant in a .json file.  
These two are combined to provide the information.  The score system is based on the type and number of violations and is not scientific.   
All the code and folders are here to open in Android Studio.
